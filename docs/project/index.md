# Carbonable Project

## ✨ Presentation

While human activities massively emit CO2, natural elements such as forests, wetlands or mangroves constitute “carbon sinks”, meaning that they capture and lock away carbon.  The regeneration of nature is one area where humanity may be able to help rebalance the climate in a relatively short time frame.  They are many nature-based decarbonization projects waiting to be financed out there.  Nature based solutions are proven, scalable and cost effective ways to lock away carbon!

The immediate safeguard and regeneration of nature is an absolute necessity. These smart-contracts are a tokenized representation of these projects selected carefully by Carbonable.

## 📖 Description

Carbonable projects are ERC-721 standard contracts. They provide nature-backed NFTs, which enable decarbonization projects and real-life impact while providing crypto-investors with ongoing financial rewards.

Each real life project is associated with an ERC-721 smart-contract, that's mean for each new project a dedicated Carbonable project smart-contract is freshly deployed.
