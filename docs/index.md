# StarkNet Smart Contracts

## Introduction

The climate emergency is the greatest challenge of our time, and requires immediate & widespread action.  
Blockchain technology is revolutionary and opens up a new world of opportunities.  
What if we leveraged Blockchain as a tool to fight climate change?

A blockchain's sovereignty is a tool that allows a community to generate the conditions needed to solve financial and coordination issues. For this reasons, to scale up our business we decided to build on StarkNet.

- Our first criteria is the energy consumption of the blockchain that we will use. This is why we choose a blockchain with a Proof of Stake consensus.
- Our second criteria is the scalability and security of the blockchain. To achieve unlimited scale always having the guarantee of a high level of security, our choice is the StarkNet permissionless decentralized ZK-Rollup operating as an L2 network over Ethereum's security.
- Our third criteria is the maturity and resilience of the blockchain. This is why we choose to rely on Ethereum blockchain.
- Our fourth criteria is the ease of access to the blockchain and a well-mature community on which CarbonABLE will develop its services.
